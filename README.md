# calculator

Features:
  - Scroll when you overflow (auto-scroll enabled)
    (shift + mouse scroll works for horizonal scrolls)
  - Full keyboard support
  - Style change when pressing buttons
  - Ans, use the answer in the next calculation
  - Number are rounded only when displayed, therefore
    at its core calculations are very precise
  - Instead of 0.5, you can use .5 and it works
  - Preventing default shortcuts (except F5) to make
    keyboard support work



Keyboard support:
  Shift + "a" or "A" => All clear
  Shift + "n" or "N" => Ans
  
  Other keys will work normally:
  Ex: Key combos like for asterix (*) work

But for now sorry about the code C:
